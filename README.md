## Task «Fun Chat»

What could be better than chatting with your friends using a chat app?
But what if the service owner deletes your messages? Or, on the contrary, they can store your chat history without your consent!
You know how to create an outstanding design and functionality, right? Let's not delay and get down to work! Let's create our own chat. We've found a ready-made server application and got a detailed description for it.

## Task Objectives

- Gain experience working with a connection where both the client and server applications can initiate sending messages.
